# gulp-water
Static Website Generator, for gulpjs.

## What is water?
Enables you yo take some content and grow it into a site.

It does not optimize anything, it just makes Markdown into HTML.

It uses a special header in each file to get meta-data about the current file.

For optimizing you could plug Water into a Gulp pipe, that could minify assets and such.
